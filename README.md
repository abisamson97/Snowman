# **SNOWMAN: SEI Project 1**

## **About the Game** 
Snowman is a game inspired by the classic game hangman. It has a winter theme, including winter related game words and a snowman in place of the hangman. Players begin by clicking the start button which will generate blanks for a word selected from a pre-generated list. Players have 9 chances to guess a letter and complete the word. Every time an incorrect letter is chosen a part of the snowman melts away. If the word is guessed a message is revealed informing the player, they have won. If the snowman melts fully before the word is guessed, the player is informed that the game is over, and they can try again.

## **Next Steps**
There are some things I would like to add to my game in the future. I would like to add responsive design so that the game can adjust to various screen sizes. I would also like to add different difficulty levels and word categories with different themes. I would display this on a home screen, and the player would be able to choose their preferneces and move onto the game screen I originally created. The last idea I have is to make some of the words phrases. Then I would add a way for the player to input the phrase as well.
